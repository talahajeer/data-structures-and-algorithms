## stacks_and_queues
A stacks is a type of data structure that is unidirectional, that is, it can be traversed in only one direction from top to first first node .
## Challenge
Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node. Within the stacks class, include a top property. Upon instantiation, an empty stacks should be created.
## Approach & Efficiency
Big O :
O(1) Time/space performance for insert method.
O(n) Time and O(1) space performance for includes method.

## Solution
